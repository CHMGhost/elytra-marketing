# Knowledge Update — November 12, 2025

## Overview
Today’s work pushed the Elytracloud marketing site from foundational beta copy toward a launch-ready experience. The focus was on documenting product progress, tightening social sharing polish, and ensuring our support content is ready for prospective customers.

## Marketing Site Additions
- **Changelog page (`/changelog`)**
  - New timeline that mirrors the entries in `CHANGELOG.md` for public consumption.
  - Summaries highlight what each phase delivered and include an “Up next” section for transparency.
  - Added site-wide navigation link so visitors can easily track progress.

- **Knowledge base metadata polish**
  - All five docs now expose Open Graph and Twitter metadata.
  - Sharing any article (provisioning, migrations, backups, recommended plugins, PHP versions) produces a consistent preview card pointing at `/og-default.png`.

## Global Assets & Components
- **Navigation**
  - Updated `SiteNav` to surface the new changelog destination alongside Features, Pricing, About, Status, and Docs.

- **Shared preview image**
  - Confirmed `public/og-default.png` exists so every page with OG metadata renders the same branded card.

## Documentation & Records
- **New knowledge entry (`docs/knowledge-2025-11-12.md`)**
  - Captures the work completed today for quick reference and future retros.

## Next Opportunities
1. Publish an announcement blog or changelog entry once the beta invite list opens.
2. Capture first-wave testimonials to pair with the changelog timeline.
3. Continue expanding the knowledge base with deployment and troubleshooting topics as they arise.
